# (No-Show-Appointments, Introduction to Data Analysis)
## by (Anjela M. Andeo)


## Overview 
> The 'No-show-appointments' is a dataset collected from 100K medical appointments in Brazil. We will be interested on finding out whether or not patients show up for their appointment and what factors to consider that will determine whether or not patients show up for their appointment day. 'ScheduledDay' tells us on what day the patient set up their appointment'Neighbourhood' indicates the location of the hospital 'Scholarship' indicates whether or not the patient is enrolled in Brasilian welfare program Bolsa Familia‘No-show’ says ‘No’ if the patient showed up to their appointment, and ‘Yes’ if they did not show up."
## Summary of Findings

After exploring our dataset with visuals, in this stage we are interested in finding out what factors to consider for us to know the outcome of patients that show up for their appointment day and also factors that won't be important to look into.

From the Observations above, the following is what I deduced:

- SMS : Even though sending of SMS would have been an important factor to consider, the results of our outcome proved to be the opposite. The number of those who received SMS and showed up were less compared to those who did not receive SMS and showed up. For better outcome, those who are supposed to attend should be sent a reminder for this would make it an effective means of communication.
- The Number of days after appointment affects the outcome in that, the higher the waiting the higher the chance of the patient not to show up for the appointment.
- Gender : This would not be vital because our dataset had more females than male and the difference in their attendance in percentage was very small.
- Age: Those aged betweed 50 and 60 years old are more likely to show up for their appointment. Similarly, atleast a higher attendance can be identified for those whose age lies between 1 and 70 years old, above 70 years old are not as much.
- Neighbourhood: This will be a good factor to put in place as those living in Andorinhas will be highly likely to show up in large numbers to other neighbourhoods.
- Alcoholism: Those who are not Alcoholic are highly likely to show up as compared to those who are alcoholic
- Scholarship: Those without scholarship would show up as compared to those who don't have.
- Handcap: This is not a good factor to consider as those who are handcap are less in number.
- Hypertension: The probability of patients who have hypertension to attend to show is lower than those who don't have it
- Diabetes: This is not an important factor to consider as those with diabetes form a small fraction of our dataset.
## Key Insights for Presentation
- How many patients who received SMS showed up for the appointment
- Does Gender affect the number of patients who show up
- How many patients showed up on the appointment date as scheduled
- Is age group a factor to consider for show up
- Does Neighbourhood affect showing up of the patients
- Does Scholarship affect showing up
- Does having diabetes affect showing up
- Does having Hypertension affect showing up
- Does being handcap affect showing up
- Does being alcoholic affect showing up
